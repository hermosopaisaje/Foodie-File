                Bibingkang kanin is a Filipino rice cake that is popular in many regions of the Philippines, including Isabela. In Isabela, bibingkang kanin is typically made with glutinous rice that is mixed with coconut milk, eggs, and sugar, and then steamed until cooked through.

                The rice mixture is usually flavored with pandan leaves, which give it a distinct green color and a fragrant aroma. Once the rice cake is cooked, it is usually topped with coconut curd, also known as latik, which is made by simmering coconut milk until it thickens and separates into oil and solids.           </p>
