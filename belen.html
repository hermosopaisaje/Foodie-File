                Isabela's longganisa is made with a combination of pork belly and ground pork, which gives it a unique flavor and texture. The meat is mixed with minced garlic, salt, sugar, and vinegar, and is then stuffed into casings and left to cure for several hours or overnight. The longganisa is then fried until crispy and browned, and is usually served with garlic fried rice and eggs for breakfast.      </p>
